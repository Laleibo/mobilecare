# CareCloud Hackathon 2016




### Introduction

This Web application as built by 5 Wyncoders during the 24 hour CareCloud Hackathon in August of 2016.  

Takes advantage of both Uber and Lyft api's, and the use of CareClouds own API.

MobileCare took home CareCloud's most innovative app award during the Hackathon.

### Uses
MobileCare was built to help doctors get their patients to their appointments on time.  

The way is works is the application pulls appointment information from CareCloud's api and determines whether the patient needs a ride.  If the patient does, it will create a mailer that will call an Uber at the specified time.  The time is determined by the driving distance to the office from the patients home address.

Access to CareCloud's API was restricted to the time during the Hackathon therefore the Application is no longer able to pull patient data and can't work properly.
